title: The Virtue of Learning Java

I hate Java. It's one of those languages that is taught because it's used and used because it's taught. It's stuck in an endless cycle of continuation in the industry because of its pre-existing prevalence. However, learning Java taught me more than I care to admit.

Java is one of the first popular object-oriented programming languages. It fixed some of the problems with the object implementation in C++ and really kickstarted the movement in Computer Science toward classed programming. However, now there are so many options in the space where there were once few. Pick up Python, Ruby, C#, Haskell, etc. and you can get the same features and more, you just have to gauge which one will perform best for the system and the task.

But Java being a teaching standard did end up doing good for me. I already knew Java well before I took a course in it; however, my degree program required me to take the course. What I found within that course, besides an easy A class, was not how to write Java, but how to write object-oriented and classed code.

I'd passed online Java courses before, and I'd written a few hacky programs in Java, but it wasn't because I knew how to write Java. I knew Java's syntax, I could bend it to my will. I made the code do what was required of it for my assignments. I never took into account the philosophy behind the language, how you were supposed to structure programs. I never wrote elegant Java (to whatever degree Java can be elegant), just functional Java.

One day I was writing Java and asked my father to look at it. He told me that I wasn't writing Java. When I questioned that, he said that I was writing in Java syntax, but I was writing code structured for another language. I didn't understand Java's structure, and it was impairing my ability to write efficient and readable code.

When I took a course in Java, I learned. I learned the beauty of a well-implemented class that encompassed all the functions I needed, infinitely instantiable and permutable within the boundaries of the application's needs. It's still not natural to me; I found myself having to completely restructure a C# project today because I wasn't writing classed and reusable code. However, I now understand the importance of writing code suited to the language and environment in which you are working.
