title: A Song of IDEs and Editors

I've never liked using Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) for programming. There's a number of issues I find myself consistently running into when using them, but it seems the entire rest of the programming populace does not. Every class I take or programmer I meet suggests a different IDE for their favourite language, and they invariably seem like crutches.  
The main reason I dislike IDEs is that they give me the ability to easily write code that I don't understand. With my recent project for my university's robotics lab, I've been struggling with getting a grasp on C# and .NET, because Visual Studio does so much automatically, without my input, and I don't really have the option of using anything else when programming a Windows GUI. A programmer should understand the code they write so that they can fix problems and (although I lack in this department) leave meaningful comments.  
I write all of my code that isn't dependent on a large library, such as the Minecraft community's Bukkit modular server framework or the Android API, in a pure text editor. Sublime Text is my editor of choice, but that's really all personal preference.  
My point is this: if you're going to use an IDE, use a text editor first. You can't truly learn a language in an IDE.
