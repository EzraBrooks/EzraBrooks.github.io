		<h1>Past</h1>
		<h2>Upbringing</h2>
		<p>My interest and skill in the field of computer science is strongly influenced by the household I grew up in. My father's side of the family contains a lot of engineers and scientists. I would relate my upbringing to that of Richard Feynman - as an inquisitive and curious child, I was never only told what things were, I was told why they were. This, I believe, has set up my mind to be very heavily reliant on logical chains to process information; a perfect strategy for computer science. I see life in cause-and-effect patterns.</p>
		<h2>A Child Among Computers</h2>
		<p>From a very early age, I had the skills required to use computers. My family will tell stories about me doing things to computers and other technology that they had no idea how I'd done; always including that I seemed very satisfied with myself afterward. The most entertaining, and in my opinion notable, story is of my first time using a computer truly independently. My grandfather kept his iMac G3 in the basement, and we spent a lot of time in the basement while he was doing work and taxes and such. One day, he had to make a phone call. According to the tale my family tells, my response was, at age three, "It's okay gandaddy, I play on my 'puter." He dismised this as just being a funny thing for a child to say, but when he came back downstairs I had booted up his iMac and was playing a game we had played in times I was at their house previous.</p>

		<h2>Playing Games and Taking Names</h2>
		<p>My first experience with video games was playing Myst while sitting on my grandfather's lap. We would figure out the puzzles in that classic masterpiece of a game together (although I doubt I contributed much) and share the experience of the story. From that point on, I've been engrossed in video games. In a way, video games have promoted my interest in computer science; due to the desire to create my own games and give back to the community I've been a member of for so long.</p>
