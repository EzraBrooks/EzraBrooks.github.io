		<h1>Past</h1>
		<h2>Upbringing</h2>
		<p>My interest and skill in the field of computer science is strongly influenced by the household I grew up in. My father's side of the family contains a lot of engineers and scientists. I would relate my upbringing to that of Richard Feynman - as an inquisitive and curious child, I was never only told what things were, I was told why they were. This, I believe, has set up my mind to be very heavily reliant on logical chains to process information; a perfect strategy for computer science. I see life in cause-and-effect patterns.</p>
		<h2>A Child Among Computers</h2>
		<p>From a very early age, I had the skills required to use computers. My family will tell stories about me doing things to computers and other technology that they had no idea how I'd done; always including that I seemed very satisfied with myself afterward. The most entertaining, and in my opinion notable, story is of my first time using a computer truly independently. My grandfather kept his iMac G3 in the basement, and we spent a lot of time in the basement while he was doing work and taxes and such. One day, he had to make a phone call. According to the tale my family tells, my response was, at age three, "It's okay gandaddy, I play on my 'puter." He dismised this as just being a funny thing for a child to say, but when he came back downstairs I had booted up his iMac and was playing a game we had played in times I was at their house previous.</p>
		<h2>Access Granted</h2>
		<p>In the early years of my life, I had most of my contact with computers through the LAN party setup in the basement. For most of my early childhood, my father had his friends over on Thursday evenings to play video games on a local network of more than ten computers that resided in our basement. As a result, I didn't have much room to be adventurous within this system; it wasn't mine, so I had to be careful what I did. Then I obtained a computer from my neighbors across the street, a Gateway desktop PC running Windows ME. Of course, we couldn't have it be Windows ME, the Vista of the time, so we installed Windows 98 Second Edition on it and christened it the "cowbox," in reference to the cow-print cube that was the Gateway logo. While this PC was not mine, I had enough free reign on it that I could learn.</p>
		<h2>Hurricane Ezra</h2>
		<p>Learning computers is a lot of trial and error, especially for children. I can't count how many times I had to completely wipe and repeat setup on the Cowbox, and on future computers I was allowed to access, because when I wasn't being a naive child and clicking on links saying I'd won a free laptop, I was experimenting with changing system variables and making systems unworkable. I left a trail of destruction in my wake; on my home computers, on family members' computers, on friends' computers - and a trail of dead fish in Fish Tycoon. I couldn't be stopped! I was too trusting of the internet and of my own abilities to make modifications and installations on systems without breaking them. Then, for a short while, I was entirely banned from using the Cowbox. Served me right, I guess.</p>
		<h2>A Computer for a Kid</h2>
		<p>I built my first computer. When I was disallowed from using the Cowbox, it was mandated by my father that I wasn't allowed to have a computer that would be my personal machine until I was able to build one. Shortly after this rule was created, I was brought home a MOTTO PC pre-built computer that had been cycled out of use at my father's workplace. Since it was prebuilt, I was required to disassemble, clean, and reassemble it for it to be "built by me" and therefore mine, so I set about that task immediately. It was then that I realized how simple this all was to me. The way I see things, the parts of computers; transistors, capacitors, printed circuit boards, and the bigger pieces these make up, are so obvious in how they should work. Computer science, hardware and software, was <i>logic</i>, something I used in most everything. It was an amazing fit for me.</p>
		<h2>Lost and Found in Linux</h2>
		<p>I wasn't allowed a Windows license, for obvious reasons. I ruined Windows PCs via their susceptibility to viruses, and Windows was expensive. So I had to use free software alternatives. I turned to Linux. The first distribution I tried was Fedora. Fedora was very new at the time I got into it, and as a result it was not the most stable of systems. I would have to reinstall Fedora every week because I would break something and it wouldn't be able to solve the problem itself; a kid running amok in a command line is not a pleasant thing for an operating system to deal with. The first thing I learned in Linux was package management. I used GUIs at first, and then realized how much more flexible the yum CLI (Command Line Interface) was, so I learned BASH.</p>
		<h2>Just the BASICs</h2>
		<p>In middle school I had my first exposure to non-command-line languages. I volunteered for a class in programming during "Workshop Week," a program at my school where we stopped taking normal classes for a week and learned arts, crafts, music, sciences - whatever we had interests in. In this class, I was taught a variation of BASIC entitled True BASIC. I'm not quite sure what makes it the "True" version of the language, but it was certainly an interesting one. This class rekindled my interest in computer science. Sure, I'd been using Linux-based systems and learning about CLIs, but I'd never programmed before then. From then on, I took it upon myself in my free time to work with a friend on a text-based game simply entitled "The Pirate Game;" we weren't extremely creative. It's a game that's about sailing the seas and plundering shipwrecks and battling off other ships. It was actually extremely fleshed out, and I've uploaded it to my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/EzraBrooks/PirateGame/blob/master/Pirates.b">here</a>.</p>
		<h2>The Alpha-Beta of Computer Science</h2>
		<p></p>
		<h2>Playing Games and Taking Names</h2>
		<p>My first experience with video games was playing Myst while sitting on my grandfather's lap. We would figure out the puzzles in that classic masterpiece of a game together (although I doubt I contributed much) and share the experience of the story. From that point on, I've been engrossed in video games. In a way, video games have promoted my interest in computer science; due to the desire to create my own games and give back to the community I've been a member of for so long.</p>
