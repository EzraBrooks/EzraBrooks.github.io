	<h1>What is a &ldquo;Game Jam&rdquo;?</h1>
	<p>A Game Jam is, traditionally, a time-limited game development competition. During the time allocated to the competition, you are to design a game from the ground up (or using a pre-existing development platform) and submit it to be judged. Those with the most complete games that are most in sync with any concept or topic the competition&#8217;s hosts put forth are featured as winners.</p>
	<h1>Why does Red Clay need one?</h1>
	<p>The goal of Red Clay Game Jam is to promote software development and game design as legitimate career pathways within the high school environment. Many schools possess no computer science education whatsoever, and most of the programs that exist are lacking. By showing what high school students can achieve in these fields in limited times and by demonstrating growth in skill between competitions, the Jam aims to show the district that game design is a career to officially support.</p>
