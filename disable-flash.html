<h1>Disable Flash</h1>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>Adobe Flash is an outdated piece of software that only inflicts performance difficulties on your computer. While many pieces of software have used Flash for streaming and other sorts of frontend tasks, these techniques are now outdated and are slowly being replaced by standards-compliant software such as HTML5 and WebM.</p>
