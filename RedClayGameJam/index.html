	<h1>What is a &ldquo;Game Jam&rdquo;?</h1>
	<p>A Game Jam is, traditionally, a time-limited game development competition. During the time allocated to the competition, you are to design a game from the ground up (or using a pre-existing development platform) and submit it to be judged. Those with the most complete games that are most in sync with any concept or topic the competition's hosts put forth are featured as winners.</p>
